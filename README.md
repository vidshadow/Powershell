1. **System Restore Point**: Automatically created before changes (can skip with `-NoRestorePoint`)
2. **Logging**: All actions logged to `%TEMP%\Win11Upgrade_[timestamp].log`
3. **Error Handling**: Non-fatal errors won't stop the entire process
4. **Compatibility Checks**: Verifies system meets Windows 11 requirements

## Troubleshooting

### TPM 2.0 Not Detected
1. **Enable in BIOS/UEFI**:
   - Restart computer
   - Enter BIOS/UEFI (usually Del, F2, or F12 during boot)
   - Look for "TPM", "Security Device", or "PTT" (Intel Platform Trust Technology)
   - Enable and save changes

2. **Check TPM status**:
   ```powershell
   Get-WmiObject -Namespace "Root\CIMv2\Security\MicrosoftTpm" -Class Win32_Tpm
   ```

### Secure Boot Not Enabled
1. Enter BIOS/UEFI settings
2. Find "Secure Boot" option (usually under "Boot" or "Security")
3. Enable Secure Boot
4. Save and restart

### Script Execution Policy Error
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

### Some Apps Won't Uninstall
This is normal for system-integrated apps. The script safely handles these cases.

## Post-Installation Recommendations

## Customization

To customize what gets removed, edit the `$bloatwareApps` array in the script:

    # Add or remove apps here
)
```
