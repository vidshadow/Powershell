Or use the standalone script:

```powershell

**Skip compatibility check:**
```powershell
.\Upgrade-To-Windows11-Debloated.ps1 -SkipCompatibilityCheck
```

**Skip restore point creation:**
```powershell
.\Upgrade-To-Windows11-Debloated.ps1 -NoRestorePoint
```

**Combine options:**

- Solitaire & Mahjong (classic games preserved)

## Safety Features

1. **System Restore Point**: Automatically created before changes (can skip with `-NoRestorePoint`)
2. **Logging**: All actions logged to `%TEMP%\Win11Upgrade_[timestamp].log`
3. **Error Handling**: Non-fatal errors won't stop the entire process
4. **Compatibility Checks**: Verifies system meets Windows 11 requirements

## Troubleshooting

### TPM 2.0 Not Detected or Secure Boot Not Supported

**Option 1: Enable in BIOS/UEFI (Recommended)**
1. Restart computer
2. Enter BIOS/UEFI (usually Del, F2, or F12 during boot)
3. Look for "TPM", "Security Device", or "PTT" (Intel Platform Trust Technology)
4. Enable TPM and Secure Boot
5. Save and restart

**Option 2: Bypass Requirements (for older hardware)**

If your hardware doesn't support TPM 2.0 or Secure Boot, use the bypass option:

```powershell
.\Upgrade-To-Windows11-Debloated.ps1 -BypassRequirements
```

This applies registry modifications that allow Windows 11 installation on unsupported hardware by bypassing:
- TPM 2.0 check
- Secure Boot check
- RAM check
- Storage check
- CPU compatibility check

**Note**: While this works for most systems, be aware that:
- Future Windows updates may have issues on unsupported hardware
- Some security features may not be available
- Microsoft recommends TPM 2.0 for full security features

**Check TPM status manually**:
```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Namespace "Root\CIMv2\Security\MicrosoftTpm" -Class Win32_Tpm
```

### Script Execution Policy Error
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

### Some Apps Won't Uninstall
This is normal for system-integrated apps. The script safely handles these cases.

## Post-Installation Recommendations

1. **Windows Update**: Check for and install all updates
   ```
   Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update
   ```

2. **Graphics Drivers**: Update to latest from manufacturer
   - NVIDIA: GeForce Experience
   - AMD: Adrenalin Software
   - Intel: Driver & Support Assistant

3. **Privacy Settings**: Review additional privacy settings
   ```
   Settings > Privacy & security
   ```

4. **Optional Features**: Remove unused Windows features
   ```
   Settings > Apps > Optional features
   ```

## Reverting Changes

If you need to undo changes:

1. **System Restore**:
   - Search "Create a restore point"
   - Click "System Restore"
   - Select the restore point created before upgrade

2. **Rollback to Windows 10** (within 10 days):
   - Settings > System > Recovery
   - Click "Go back" under "Recovery options"

## Customization

To customize what gets removed, edit the `$bloatwareApps` array in the script:

```powershell
$bloatwareApps = @(
    "Microsoft.XboxApp",
    "Microsoft.YourPhone",
    # Add or remove apps here
)
```

## Security Notes

- Scripts are **defensive security tools** for personal system administration
- All changes can be reverted via System Restore
- No registry modifications that break Windows functionality
- Scripts use official Microsoft upgrade tools only

## Logs

All operations are logged to: `%TEMP%\Win11Upgrade_[timestamp].log`

View logs:
```powershell
notepad $env:TEMP\Win11Upgrade_*.log
```
